        For our final project, we examined a dataset of over 80,000 reported
        Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) sightings from 1906 to 2014. We are
        both interested in astronomy and thought it would be valuable to look
        more in-depth into people's experiences with UFOs. Most existing
        reporting and analysis of UFO sightings is localized to certain regions
        or countries, but the dataset we examined is cross-national and
        continental, albeit with most of the reported sightings in the United
        States.

        First, we looked at the geographic breakdown of UFO sightings. Most of
        the reports are from the United States, with Europe in second place.
        Most of the reports within the United States are on the East coast.

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.
